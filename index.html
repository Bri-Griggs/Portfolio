                        I am currently attending Base Camp Coding Academy as a part of the
                        Graduate Institute where they are teaching me many languages to prepare
                        me for entering the field of Software Development. As of right now, I have
                        learned python and am learning html and CSS. I am also an artist with a
                        Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design and am looking to combine it with all
                        that I have learned from BCCAGI and take my creativity to the next level!

                    did not stop me and my group from communicating and working on the project.
                    We decided that we would make a horror maze program. There would be 4 ways
                    to enter the maze but only 2 would lead to the center. My path, the west path,
                    was the shortest and deadliest route but in my opinion I think it was the
                    most fun part to code. </span>

                    a program that seemed more realistic, so our solution was a program that would
                    manage the totally "real"-iable Solkswagens vehicles.
                    Along with viewing cars, the program also has set admins
                    that can edit the car system and promote customers to moderators
                    while the customers can browse it.

                    I chose my beautiful cat S'more. I drew the background
                    for the site myself and included a link to a tiktok embedded in the images of S'more's
                    up top. In this tiktok I made it look like the user could be taking him to
                    the park and push S'more around in his very beloved pink stroller.</span>
