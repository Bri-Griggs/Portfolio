                        I am currently attending Base Camp Coding Academy as a part of the
                        Graduate Institute where they are teaching me many languages to prepare
                        me for entering the field of Software Development. As of right now, I have
                        learned python, html and CSS, Javascript, and now learning Django. I am also an artist with a
                        Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design and am looking to combine it with all
                        that I have learned from BCCAGI and take my creativity to the next level!

                    did not stop me and my group from communicating and working on the project.
                    We decided that we would make a horror maze program. There would be 4 ways
                    to enter the maze but only 2 would lead to the center. My path, the west path,
                    was the shortest and deadliest route but in my opinion I think it was the
                    most fun part to code. </span>

                    Along with viewing cars, the program also has set admins

                    I chose my beautiful cat S'more. I drew the background

                    up top. In this tiktok I made it look like the user could be taking him to
                    the park and push S'more around in his very beloved pink stroller.</span>

                    is very dear to all of us called Avatar: The Last Airbender. In this library the user is presented
                    with cards based on characters from the show. With these cards the user can edit, update, and delete

                    Recently I was finally able to see him live with a fellow class mate of mine as well and we had a
                    cool idea to use Django to make a side website for his music. She is the backend expert and I
                    really love working in front end so we thought this would be a fun opportunity. It is currently
                    a work in progress and not complete but we are both so excited to make it because we both love Owl
                    City and wanted to combine our passion with coding with our love for his music to make this project.

                    a date and a time for the appointment. If the user has an appointment, they are able to change the

                    because due to circumstances each one of us were absent at different times for the same amount of
                    time and though that sounds scary we came out with a great project.
                    Cupid Shuffle requires the user
                    to
                    register an account, sign in, make a dating profile, log out, and take a personality quiz. With the
                    personality quiz
                    the user can be calculated matches if they have 3 items or more in common with each other. The user
                    if unsatisfied
                    or satisfied and married can also delete their account.
