            <p>Hello! My name is Briana and I am an upcoming Software Developer.
                I am currently attending Base Camp Coding Academy as a part of the
                Graduate Institute where they are teaching me many languages to prepare
                me for entering the field of Software Development. As of right now, I have
                learned python and am learning html and CSS. I am also an artist with a
                Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design and am looking to combine it with all
                that I have learned from BCCAGI and take my creativity to the next level!

        <span class="caption">This was my first group project. Though I was on my honeymoon, that
            did not stop me and my group from communicating and working on the project.
            We decided that we would make a horror maze program. There would be 4 ways
            to enter the maze but only 2 would lead to the center. My path, the west path,
            was the shortest and deadliest route but in my opinion I think it was the
            most fun part to code. While a user journeyed through the maze they would
            have opportunities to encounter creatures which could kill the users and end
            their journey. But there are also items that the user can find through the maze
            that can defeat creatures but the item varies per creature so the user has to hope
            that they have the correct item. Creatures are not the only way the user can die in
            the maze. Along with creatures, the maze contains actual "dead" ends that
            will open up and swallow the user and instant kill you. But there are
        other dead ends that are not deadly at all that the user can run into. These dead ends
    actually allow the user to restart the maze and try again meanwhile death means no restart
and game over.</span>

        <div class="title_glow"><h2>Unit 2 Project: Solksvwagen Sales Management System</h2></div>
        <span class="caption">This was my second group project. My team wanted to make
            a program that seemed more realistic so we came up with a program that would
            manage cars. Along with viewing cars, the program also has set admins
            that can edit the car system while the customers can browse it. With customer
            privileges, the user can create an account and browse cars by year, price,
            and color. With administrative privileges, which are already set in the program,
            admins can promote a customer to a moderator.With moderator privileges the user
            can manage admin users as well as manage the stock by adding and removing to the
            stock.With managing other users, administrators can search for users, display all
            users, promote users, demote users, or delete users. As a moderator the user cannot
            demote or promote but can delete users. If an admin demotes a moderator, they become
            a customer. A really fun part about this project is that we learned hashing which was
            an advanced skill for storing and saving passwords.

        <span class="caption">For our first project in html and CSS, my class was tasked with making a webpage
            for our GOAT (Greatest of all time). The task was to make a webpage 
            describing why they are our GOAT. I chose my cat S'more. I drew the background
            for the site myself and included a link to my tiktok embeded in one of S'more's
             pictures. In this tik tok I made it look like the user could be taking him to
             the park and push S'more around in his very beloved pink stroller.</span>
